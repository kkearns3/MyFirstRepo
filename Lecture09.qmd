# Data Frames

Create a vector with strings in it

```{r}
char_vec <- c('duck', 'goose', 'moose', 'mallard')
sort(char_vec)
```

Data frames are useful for storing 2-d data

-   all entries in a column have the same data type
-   each column have the same number of values

Recall that data() gives us all the different datasets we have in the packages in our environment

Found data frame called trees

```{r}
trees$Height
```
Column names are attributes:

```{r}
names(trees)
colnames(trees)[2:3]
```
