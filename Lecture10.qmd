## Lecture 10 - Lists

-   Lists are one-dimensional, and heterogeneous

Investigating the data frame
```{r}
is.list(trees)
```
```{r}
is.data.frame(trees)
```
Can subset as a list
```{r}
trees[1]
```
Double brackets only return a single item, you can't return more than one column

```{r}
trees[[1]]
```
Lists are very useful because they can store a wide variety of things. Most modeling functions output in the form of a list

E.g. linear model on trees data frame
```{r}
fit <- lm(Volume ~ Height + Girth, data=trees)
str(fit, max.level = 1)
```
Helper functions
```{r}
#can use this:
fit$coefficients

#but it has a helper function:
coef(fit)

```
```{r}
fit$residuals
residuals(fit)
```
These helper functions exist for many attributes, but not all (e.g. nothing for rank)

```{r}

```
